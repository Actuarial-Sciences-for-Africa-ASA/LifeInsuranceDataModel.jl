# LifeInsuranceDataModel.jl

The notion of section is used here to describe object revisions as of a certain pair of points in - 2 dimensional - transaction and reference time. So it is a geometrical metaphor of two crossing cuts = i.e. sections - reducing 2D-transaction and reference time to 1D-reference time using a point in transaction time and reducing 1D-reference time using a point in reference time to yield a point in the version space.
